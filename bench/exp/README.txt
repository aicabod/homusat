This directory contains the 136 benchmark problems used in the experiments in our APLAS 2019 paper.

They are obtained from benchmark sets for TravMC2 [1], HorSat2 [2], and HorSatP [3] via the translation of Kobayashi et al.'s POPL 2017 paper [4].
The source of each file is written at the top of the file as a comment.

Note that the HORS model checking problems written in HORS + CASE format are not included because they cannot be converted into HFL model checking problems by the translator we used (its implementation is rather naive).
Some files that HorSatP emits error while processing are also excluded.
